				<strong>Data-Intensive Vehicle Routing</strong>
			</div>
			<div style="float:right; width:100%;">
				<!--<strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>-->
				As the society-wide digitalization unfolds, important societal
				processes are being captured at an unprecedented level of detail, in turn
				enabling us to better understand and improve those processes. Vehicular
				transportation is one such process, where the availability of vehicle
				trajectories holds the potential to enable better routing. The speaker argues
				that with massive trajectory data available, the traditional vehicle routing
				paradigm, Dijkstra’s paradigm, where a road network is modeled as a graph and
				where travel costs such as travel times are assigned to edges, is obsolete.
				Instead, new and data-intensive paradigms that thrive on data are called for.
				The talk will cover several such paradigms: a path-based paradigm, where
				travel costs are associated with paths and not just graph edges; an
				on-the-fly paradigm, where high-resolution travels costs are not pre-computed
				but are computed from purposefully selected trajectories during vehicle
				routing; and a cost-oblivious paradigm, where routing is done without the
				use of travel costs. These paradigms present new challenges and opportunities
				to research in routing.

				<strong>Are Green Buildings Healthy?</strong>
			</div>
			<div style="float:right; width:100%;">
				<!--<strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>-->
				Buildings account for 40% of carbon dioxide emission in the US (and
				more during construction). Thus, the goal of Green Buildings to minimize
				resource usage and carbon footprint during construction and use is not
				surprising. While Green Buildings may be healthy for the environment, given
				that the average person spends 90% of his or her time indoors, it is
				reasonable to ask if the occupants of such buildings are safe and
				productive. These goals can work against each other. For example, limiting
				hot water flow and temperature to reduce water and electricity usage can
				encourage the growth of harmful bacterial mats. Reducing outdoor air flow
				to lower heating and cooling costs can raise the rebreathed fraction of air
				in a room, contributing to disease transmission. Obtaining quantitative
				results on human well-being and performance in Green Buildings is
				challenging, but certainly must start with a characterization of conditions
				in and around buildings. This talk will elucidate the requirements for data
				and analysis infrastructure needed to investigate the performance of Green
				Buildings, by looking at specific needs for sample research questions. From
				there, I go to a proposed architecture for such a system, and then discuss
				initial experiences in prototyping such a system based on data from a
				Building Management Systems and additional sensor platforms. I then discuss
				several interesting problems that have emerged from this work, including:
				(a) Agile data integration, particularly temporal and spatial alignment of
				datasets. (b) Exploiting data annotations to support visualization and
				analysis. (c) Capturing the human element in building performance.
